201010_Parser:
 - Task: Implement a parser for a simple expression tree.
 - Contents:
   - Expressions.hs:
       The expression tree implementation, some demonstration catamorphisms,
       and the concrete parser, using combinators from Parser.hs.
   - Parser.hs:
       A parser combinator library implementation, based on code from the 
       October Hoodlums meeting and from the 1998 paper "Monadic parsing in 
       Haskell" by Hutton and Meijer.
   - main.hs:
       A simple program to test the above; takes a string from the user and
       attempts to parse, doing some simple error checking.
       - compile with ghc --make main
